## ChatRoom

**Description:** A simple chat room application where multiple clients can connect and exchange messages in real time.

**Learning Goal:** Understand message broadcasting, concurrency, and synchronization in a distributed environment.

---

## Client-Server-Communication

**Description:** A basic client-server model demonstrating direct communication between a client and a server.

**Learning Goal:** Learn the fundamentals of socket programming and request-response patterns in distributed systems.

---

## FileStorageSystem

**Description:** A distributed file storage system that allows clients to store and retrieve files from a server.

**Learning Goal:** Explore file transfer protocols, data consistency, and storage management in distributed architectures.

---

## Key-Value Store

**Description:** A simple distributed key-value store supporting basic CRUD operations.

**Learning Goal:** Understand distributed data storage, key-value paradigms, and basic replication strategies.

---

## Load-Balancer

**Description:** A load balancer that distributes incoming client requests across multiple backend servers.

**Learning Goal:** Learn about load balancing algorithms, fault tolerance, and scalability in distributed systems.

---

## Time-Based-Task-Scheduler

**Description:** A scheduler that executes tasks at specified times, simulating distributed cron jobs.

**Learning Goal:** Study task scheduling, time synchronization, and distributed coordination.
